# Overview


Notebooks for MLRS 2019. This repo contains the notebooks with only simplified code blocks. The lecture slides will be uploaded later.


## Installations

[**Note**: The installation slides can be find [here](https://github.com/goldmermaid/mlrs/blob/master/installations.pdf).]

Check [step-by-step instructions](http://numpy.d2l.ai/chapter_appendix/aws.html) to setup the running environments on **AWS EC2**. Please make sure to submit a limit increase by the noon of the first day of MLRS2019.

What is more, if you would like to install **locally** (Mac and Linux available), check [step-by-step instructions](http://numpy.d2l.ai/chapter_install/install.html) here.
